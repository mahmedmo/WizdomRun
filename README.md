  - How to navigate and play the game.

### 3. 📚 Campaign Setup & Notes Import
- **Campaign Options:** Start a new campaign or continue an existing one.
- **Notes Import (CH):** Users import study notes.
- **LLM Processing:** The LLM extracts key terminology/concepts and generates three question sets: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard** (CH).

### 4. 🛤️ Campaign Structure

  - **Quest (Short)**
  - **Odyssey (Medium)**
  - **Saga (Long)**
