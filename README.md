## Project Summary

Learning complex terminology often feels like a tedious chore, draining motivation and focus. Our solution transforms this challenge into an engaging adventure‚Äîempowering learners to master new concepts through an immersive game-based experience. Study sessions become captivating quests for growth!

## Project Overview

### üë§ Splash Screen & Authentication (MH)

- **Splash Screen:** On launch, users are greeted with a dynamic screen displaying the game‚Äôs title and environment.
- **Authentication:** Users can log in or sign up.

### üé® Character Creation & Tutorial (MH)

- **Character Creation:** After account creation, users choose and customize their wizard (CH).
- **Tutorial:** Explains game mechanics:
  - How to import notes for study.
  - How to navigate and play the game.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Campaign Setup & Notes Import

- **Campaign Options:** Start a new campaign or continue an existing one.
- **Notes Import (CH):** Users import study notes.
- **LLM Processing:** The LLM extracts key terminology/concepts and generates three question sets: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard** (CH).

### üé≠ Campaign Structure

- **Campaign Length:** Users choose from:
  - **Quest (Short)**
  - **Odyssey (Medium)**
  - **Saga (Long)**
- **Difficulty Progression:** Questions progress from easy (early levels) to hard (later levels).

### ‚åõÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics

- **Auto-Run:** The player character runs automatically through diverse environments.
- **Combat:** Enemies appear; players cast spells to defeat them.
- **Mana System:**
  - **Spell Cost:** Casting spells consumes mana.
  - **Mana Replenishment:** Tapping a button prompts a question:
    - **Correct Answer:** Replenishes mana.
    - **Incorrect Answer:** No mana gain, limiting spell usage.
- **Special Events:** Correct responses during events grant additional spells/abilities. _(SH)_

### üó°Ô∏è Boss Battles: Turn-Based Combat

- **Boss Encounter:** At the end of each level, a boss battle begins.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics:**
  - Players receive a hand of cards with unique buffs or bonuses.
  - Playing a card triggers a question:
    - **Correct Answer:** Grants bonuses or extra spells.
    - **Incorrect Answer:** Causes the player to skip a turn.
- **Progression:** Defeating the boss advances the player, carrying over any gained abilities.

### üèÜ Winning, Losing, and Achievements

- **Failure Limit:** Three losses in a level result in campaign failure and restart.
- **Achievements:** Successful campaign completions are celebrated and saved on the **Achievements Page** (CH) in the main menu.
