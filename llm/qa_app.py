    Create exactly {num_q} multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based solely on the following notes:\n\n{context}\n\n
    Each question must have exactly 4 answer choices labeled A, B, C, and D.
    The difficulty level for all questions is: {difficulty}.
    Do not generate additional questions beyond the specified number ({num_q}).
    Ensure the questions:
    - Cover different topics and sections from the entire document, not just a small portion.
    - Are completely distinct and not reworded versions of the following previous questions:\n{previous_questions_str}\n
    - Explore unique aspects of the content that havenâ€™t been addressed yet.
    - Randomize the position of the correct answer between A, B, C, and D.
    Format the output strictly as follows, with precisely {num_q} questions:

    Q1: <question text> ({difficulty})
    A) <option 1>
    B) <option 2>
    C) <option 3>
    D) <option 4>
    Answer: <correct option>

    Ensure that the correct answer appears randomly in different options A, B, C, or D rather than just at position B. Let's begin:
